# Introduction 
The Academy Award for "Best Animated Feature Film", first introduced at the 74th Academy Awards is a prestigious award. Even being nominated is great, and it benefits directors, production companies, etc. because it attracts more talent, earns more at the box office, and in general increases awareness about a movie and the people who worked on it.

The goal of our project is to create a model that can 'predict' whether an animated film will be nominated for Best Animated Feature Film or not.

# Data Collection 
We collected our information about the animated movies from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb). In IMDb every movie, person, and company has a unique imdb id. Associated with this imdb id is a host of information that we use. Our 'dataset' consists of a combination of data collected from the IMDb website using both web scraping and Cinemagoer Python package. A detailed description of the dataset is available in the file [Dataset Description](https://github.com/wrlaxboy151/may22-lunar-outpost/blob/main/Dataset%20Description.docx)
